			<h1> Chapter 1</h1>
			<p>
				It was the first day of high school. Ada, who spent the night solving a buffer overflow challenge on Root-me was tired.
			<p>
			<p>
				She wasn't used to sleep a lot but two hours was not enough, even for her.
		  </p>
		  <p>However, she had to go out of bed. Her father, head of state police Security, had an important presentation and could not afford to be late. She drank her coffee in two sips, rushed in the alley and jumped in the car. She tried to put a rap radio but here father changed it instantly:
		  You know I don't want that kind of music in my car. And you know I'd rather talk to you. </p>
		
			<p>

			She made a quick program in Javascript:
